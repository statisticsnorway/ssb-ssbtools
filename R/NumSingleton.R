#' 
#' A \code{\link{GaussSuppression}} `singletonMethod` starting with `"num"` is decoded into separate characters.
#' Part of the theory for interpreting the 3rd, 4th, and 5th characters is discussed in Langsrud (2024). 
#' To utilize possibly duplicated contributor IDs, the 2nd character must be `"T"`.
#' 
#' Any `F` means the feature is turned off.  
#' Other characters have the following meaning:
#' 
#' 1. `singleton2Primary` (1st character): 
#'   \itemize{
#'   \item `T`: All singletons are forced to be primary suppressed. 
#'   \item `t`: Non-published singletons are primary suppressed.
#'   }
#' 2. `integerUnique` (2nd character): 
#'   \itemize{
#'   \item `T`: Integer values representing the unique contributors are utilized.  Error if `singleton` not supplied as integer.  
#'   \item `t`: As `T` above, but instead of error, the feature is turned off  (as `F`) if `singleton` is not supplied as integer.   
#'   }
#' 3. `sum2` (3rd character): 
#'  \itemize{
#'   \item `T`: Virtual primary suppressed cells are made, 
#'       which are the sum of some suppressed inner cells and which can be divided into two components.
#'       At least one component is singleton contributor. The other component may be an inner cell. 
#'   \item `H`: As `T` above. And in addition, the other component can be any primary suppressed published cell. 
#'       This method may be computationally demanding for big data.  
#'   }
#' 4. `elimination` (4th character): 
#'   \itemize{
#'   \item `t`: The singleton problem will be handled by methodology implemented as a part of the Gaussian elimination algorithm.
#'   \item `m`: As `t` above. And in addition, a message will be printed to inform about problematic singletons.
#'       Actual reveals will be calculated when `singleton2Primary = T` (1st character) 
#'       and when `singleton2Primary = t` yield the same result as `singleton2Primary = T`.
#'       Problematic singletons can appear since the algorithm is not perfect in the sense that the elimination of rows may cause problems. 
#'       Such problems can be a reason not to switch off `sum2`.
#'   \item `w`: As `m` above, but `warning` instead of `message`.
#'   \item `T`, `M` and `W`: As `t`, `m` and `w` above. 
#'       In addition, the gauss elimination routine is allowed to run in parallel with different sortings 
#'      so that the problem of eliminated singleton rows is reduced.  
#'   \item `f`: As `F`, which means that the elimination feature is turned off. 
#'      However, when possible, a message will provide information about actual reveals, similar to `m` above.                  
#'   }
#' 5. `combinations` (5th character): 
#'   \itemize{
#'   \item `T`: This is a sort of extension of `singleton2Primary` which is relevant when both `integerUnique` and `elimination` are used. 
#'      For each unique singleton contributor, the method seeks to protect all linear combinations of singleton cells from the unique contributor.
#'      Instead of construction new primary cells, protection is achieved as a part of the elimination procedure. 
#'      Technically this is implemented by extending the above `elimination` method.  
#'      It cannot be guaranteed that all problems are solved, and this is a reason not to turn off `singleton2Primary`. 
#'      Best performance is achieved when `elimination` is `T`, `M` or `W`. 
#'   \item `t`:  As `T`, but without the added singleton protection. 
#'      This means that protected linear combinations cannot be calculated linearly from non-suppressed cells. 
#'      However, other contributors may still be able to recalculate these combinations using their own suppressed values.
#'   }
#'   
#'   
#' @note Note an update made in SSBtools version 1.7.3, which relates to this sentence in Langsrud (2024):  
#' *"The remaining non-zero rows for columns corresponding to primary cells must not originate solely from one contributor."*  
#' Due to speed and memory considerations, the algorithm does not first perform elimination and then check the result. 
#' Instead, it first verifies whether elimination is permissible before executing it. 
#' This approach allows for a more thorough validation process compared to performing elimination with a fixed row order.  
#' Specifically, this means that the singleton procedure, denoted as `elimination` (4th character), 
#' can take into account different row orders. 
#' Such an improvement was introduced in SSBtools version 1.7.3 after the publication of Langsrud (2024). 
#' As a result, more potential issues can now be detected during 
#' a single elimination sequence (`t` as the 4th character), 
#' slightly reducing the need for double elimination (`T` as the 4th character). 
#' However, since the row order influences subsequent elimination steps, 
#' double elimination remains an important safeguard.
