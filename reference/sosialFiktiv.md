# Fictitious datasets returned by SSBtoolsData()

The most comprehensive dataset, `sosialFiktiv`, contains three
dimensions. The first dimension is 'region' which is grouped in two
ways, 'fylke' and 'kostragr'. The other two are 'hovedint' and 'mnd'. In
'mnd2' two of the three categories in 'mnd' are merged. The other
datasets (`z1`, `z1w`, `z2`, `z2w`, `z3`, `z3w`, `z3wb`) are smaller
subdatasets. Datasets marked with '`w`' are unstacked and several
variables are holding counts.
